<p>

The table below tallies all function calls to all packages ('ncalls'), both internal (r-base + recommended, along with the package itself), and external (imported and suggested packages). 'NA' values indicate packages to which no identified calls to R functions could be found. Note that these results are generated by an automated code-tagging system which may not be entirely accurate.

|type       |package    | ncalls|
|:----------|:----------|------:|
|internal   |base       |    447|
|internal   |pkgstats   |     99|
|internal   |stats      |     16|
|internal   |graphics   |     10|
|internal   |utils      |     10|

|suggests   |testthat   |     NA|
|linking_to |cpp11      |     NA|

Click below for tallies of functions used in each package. Locations of each call within this package may be generated locally by running 's <- pkgstats::pkgstats(<path/to/repo>)', and examining the 'external_calls' table.



**NOTE:** Some imported packages appear to have no associated function calls; please ensure with author that these 'Imports' are listed appropriately.

### 3. Statistical Properties

This package features some noteworthy statistical properties which may need to be clarified by a handling editor prior to progressing.

Statistical properties of package structure as distributional percentiles in relation to all current CRAN packages
The following terminology is used:

- `loc` = "Lines of Code"
- `fn` = "function"
- `exp`/`not_exp` = exported / not exported

All parameters are explained as tooltips in the locally-rendered HTML version of this report generated by [the `checks_to_markdown()` function](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgcheck/reference/checks_to_markdown.html)


The final measure (`fn_call_network_size`) is the total number of calls between functions (in R), or more abstract relationships between code objects in other languages. Values are flagged as "noteworthy" when they lie in the upper or lower 5th percentile.

|measure                 | value| percentile|noteworthy |
